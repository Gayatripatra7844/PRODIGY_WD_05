# PRODIGY_WD_05
# Weather App

This project is a simple web page that fetches weather data from a weather API based on the user's location or a user-inputted location. It provides real-time weather information and a forecast for the next few days.

# Features
1. Geolocation-based Weather Data: Automatically fetches weather data based on the user’s current geographical location using the browser’s geolocation API.
2. Search Functionality: Allows users to input a location (city name, ZIP code, etc.) to retrieve weather data for that specific area.
3. Current Weather Information: Displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
4. Forecast Information: Provides a forecast for the next few days, including high and low temperatures, weather conditions, and more.
5. Responsive Design: Ensures the web page is accessible and looks good on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
6. Interactive Elements: Includes user-friendly features such as autocomplete for location search, weather icons, and animations for different weather conditions.
7. Error Handling: Manages errors gracefully, such as invalid location inputs or issues with fetching data from the weather API.
# Technologies Used
1. HTML5: The backbone of the web page, providing the basic structure and elements.
2. CSS3: Used for styling the web page, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design. Frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS can be used for rapid development.
3. JavaScript (ES6+): Implements the core functionality, including fetching data from the weather API, handling user input, and updating the UI dynamically.
4. Weather API: A third-party API service such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, or AccuWeather to provide real-time weather data and forecasts.
5. Geolocation API: Utilized to obtain the user’s current geographical coordinates for location-based weather data fetching.
6. AJAX/Fetch API: For making asynchronous requests to the weather API and updating the web page without needing a full reload.
# Frameworks/Libraries:
1. React.js or Vue.js: For building a more interactive and efficient user interface.
2. Axios: A popular promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
3. Node.js & Express (Optional): If server-side processing or API proxying is required, Node.js and Express can be used to set up a backend server.
4. Local Storage: To store user preferences or recent searches, enhancing the user experience.
